Introduction of DBMS (Database Management System) 
A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that is designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner. It allows users to create, modify, and query a database, as well as manage the security and access controls for that database.

DBMS provides an environment to store and retrieve the data in coinvent and efficient manner.

Key Features of DBMS
Data modeling: A DBMS provides tools for creating and modifying data models, which define the structure and relationships of the data in a database.
Data storage and retrieval: A DBMS is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database, and can provide various methods for searching and querying the data.
Concurrency control: A DBMS provides mechanisms for controlling concurrent access to the database, to ensure that multiple users can access the data without conflicting with each other.
Data integrity and security: A DBMS provides tools for enforcing data integrity and security constraints, such as constraints on the values of data and access controls that restrict who can access the data.
Backup and recovery: A DBMS provides mechanisms for backing up and recovering the data in the event of a system failure.
DBMS can be classified into two types: Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and Non-Relational Database Management System (NoSQL or Non-SQL)
RDBMS: Data is organized in the form of tables and each table has a set of rows and columns. The data are related to each other through primary and foreign keys.
NoSQL: Data is organized in the form of key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or column-based. These are designed to handle large-scale, high-performance scenarios.
A database is a collection of interrelated data which helps in the efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of data from the database and organizes the data in the form of tables, views, schemas, reports, etc. For Example, a university database organizes the data about students, faculty, admin staff, etc. which helps in the efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of data from it.

COMPARISION BETWEEN DBMS AND RDBMS

DBMS	                                                           RDBMS
DBMS stores data as file.	                                   RDBMS stores data in tabular form.
Data elements need to access individually.	                   Multiple data elements can be accessed at the same time.
No relationship between data.	                                   Data is stored in the form of tables which are related to each other.
Normalization is not present.	                                   Normalization is present.
DBMS does not support distributed database.	                   RDBMS supports distributed database.
It stores data in either a navigational or hierarchical form.	   It uses a tabular structure where the headers are the column names, and the rows contain corresponding values.
It deals with small quantity of data.	                           It deals with large amount of data.
Data redundancy is common in this model.	                   Keys and indexes do not allow Data redundancy.
It is used for small organization and deal with small data.	   It is used to handle large amount of data.
Not all Codd rules are satisfied.	                           All 12 Codd rules are satisfied.
Security is less	                                           More security measures provided.
It supports single user.	                                   It supports multiple users.
Data fetching is slower for the large amount of data.	           Data fetching is fast because of relational approach.
The data in a DBMS is subject to low security levels with          There exists multiple levels of data security in a RDBMS.
 regards to data manipulation.	                                  
Low software and hardware necessities.	                           Higher software and hardware necessities.
Examples: XML, Window Registry, Forxpro, dbaseIIIplus etc.	   Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, Microsoft Access etc.
