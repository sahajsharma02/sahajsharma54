DBMS	                                                           RDBMS
DBMS stores data as file.	                                   RDBMS stores data in tabular form.
Data elements need to access individually.	                   Multiple data elements can be accessed at the same time.
No relationship between data.	                                   Data is stored in the form of tables which are related to each other.
Normalization is not present.	                                   Normalization is present.
DBMS does not support distributed database.	                   RDBMS supports distributed database.
It stores data in either a navigational or hierarchical form.	   It uses a tabular structure where the headers are the column names, and the rows contain corresponding values.
It deals with small quantity of data.	                           It deals with large amount of data.
Data redundancy is common in this model.	                   Keys and indexes do not allow Data redundancy.
It is used for small organization and deal with small data.	   It is used to handle large amount of data.
Not all Codd rules are satisfied.	                           All 12 Codd rules are satisfied.
Security is less	                                           More security measures provided.
It supports single user.	                                   It supports multiple users.
Data fetching is slower for the large amount of data.	           Data fetching is fast because of relational approach.
The data in a DBMS is subject to low security levels with          There exists multiple levels of data security in a RDBMS.
 regards to data manipulation.	                                  
Low software and hardware necessities.	                           Higher software and hardware necessities.
Examples: XML, Window Registry, Forxpro, dbaseIIIplus etc.	   Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, Microsoft Access etc.
